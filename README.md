# Project_S
The game project is a top-down Shoot-Em-UP or schmupt or Bullet hell game created for a senior project.
For my part of the project I created camera boundaries for the game, restricting the map into a rectangular box similar to that of the Touhou series. I also designed the User Interface for teh game, including the menu and the in-game overlay.
I also contributed in modifying enemy spawn locations and behavior in the game - changing the direction of enemy movements and implementing different numbers and/or types of enemies that can come out of one spawn point.
I also contributed in modifying enemy attack patterns, from homing bullet that chases the player, singular bullets in standard Bullet Hell games, and multi-bullets such as the triple shots.
